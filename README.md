Title: Program on Data Types in C++

Tools used: Visual Studio Code

# Overview
This program explores some of the most commonly used data types in C++. The main objective is to understand how different types of data are stored in memory, how much space each occupies, and how to use them effectively in a program.

# Data Types Covered
Integer (int)

Stores whole numbers like 5, 100, -42
Usually takes 4 bytes of memory

Float (float)

Used for decimal values with single precision like 3.14, -0.5
Typically takes 4 bytes

Double (double)

Stores decimal values with double precision, offering more accuracy than float
Occupies 8 bytes

Character (char)

Stores a single character such as 'A' or 'z'
Takes 1 byte of memory

String (string)

Stores a sequence of characters, e.g., "Hello"
Memory size varies since it uses dynamic memory allocation

Boolean (bool)

Represents truth values: true or false
Still takes 1 byte, despite representing only 0 or 1

# Key Concepts Demonstrated
sizeof() Operator
Used to determine how many bytes each data type occupies in memory.

Memory vs Value
Even though some values (like a bool) are small in terms of information, they still take standard memory sizes due to how systems store them.

Choosing the Right Type
The correct data type depends on the requirement:
Use int for counting, float or double for decimals, char for single letters, and string for words or sentences.

# Input & Output
Learned how to use cin and cout for taking input and displaying output in C++.

SampleOutput
Enter any integer:12

Integer = 12 and size is 4 bytes

Enter any number with decimal:12.12

Float= 12.12 and size is 4 bytes

Enter any number with decimal:12.78

Double= 12.78 and size is 8 bytes

Enter any string: Pal
String = Pal and size is 32 bytes
Enter any character: h
Character = h and size is 1 bytes
Enter any boolean: true
Boolean = 0 and size is 1 bytes

# Observations
A bool takes 1 byte, not just 1 bit, due to system memory alignment.

double is more precise than float, but consumes more memory.

string is not a primitive type like int; it handles memory dynamically and is more complex internally.

Understanding data types is fundamental to writing efficient and correct C++ programs. This program helped visualize how much memory different variables take and emphasized the importance of choosing the appropriate type based on data and performance needs.
